- 👋 Hi **(Привет!)**, I’m @Bogdahn-Ishenko
  
- 👀 I’m interested in being passionate about web design, particularly UI/UX, and working in front-end development.
  I enjoy developing interactive user interfaces, creating prototypes, and testing user experiences.
  I love turning complex tasks into simple, intuitive, and aesthetically pleasing design solutions.
  Additionally, I actively learn new technologies and frameworks to stay on top of modern trends in front-end development.
  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning at a university and enhancing my skills at a front-end school.
  I’m diving deep into the latest web technologies and design trends, and applying them to real-world projects.
  This dual approach of theoretical learning and practical application is helping me to rapidly improve my front-end development skills.
  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects or roles where I can develop my skills and contribute in both design and front-end development.
   I am eager to apply my knowledge and creativity to solve complex problems and create user-friendly interfaces.
